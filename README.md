# AWS-Powered-Earth-to-Earth-Distance-Calculator

This fully functional web application is built by integrating five core AWS tools — Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This app allows users to input latitude and longitude for two points on Earth, like two cities or two of your favorite destinations, and calculates the distance between them in kilometers.
